Staffscanner is an online and mobile platform that matches and connects Registered

suitable professionals for clients to engage.

For ease of reference, the Site, Network, Matching Service, User profiles, our
proprietary information and any other Staffscanner products or services are

Account Registration and Compliance

You acknowledge and agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete
information about yourself as prompted by the registration form. If any information
provided by you is or becomes untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, you agree
to inform Staffscanner immediately or update on your online profile. Failure to do so
may result in your account being suspended or terminated without notice and future
use of our site thereafter being refused.

Staffscanner has a robust compliance and account registration process which is
mandatory and includes meeting a member of the compliance team. Staffscanner at
its sole discretion (without giving reason or explanation) can refuse Professionals or
Clients access to the Staffscanner Properties prior to signing up, during the signing up
process or at anytime thereafter. It is our policy not to divulge any reason for doing
so. Furthermore, if a Professional has five or more ratings of two stars or below they
will be removed from the system without explanation or notice, this is to ensure quality
assurance and good care delivery.

During the registration process you will be asked to provide referee details for both
your current/most recent and previous employers, in order that we may obtain
references to establish your suitability for the role for which you have applied. Due to
the current pandemic we may also accept alternative forms of care employment
evidence such as pay slips/P45.

Prior to signing up to the service, during our vetting process, or any time thereafter as
well as in our performance of periodic checks, if information is inaccurate or raises any
concerns (at our sole discretion) then you may be suspended from the platform without
consultation, you may also be subject to disciplinary action, including but not limited
to dismissal.

Where applicable we reserve the right to reject any documents submitted as part of
our User registration of which we are under no obligation to test the accuracy or
authenticity.

As part of the registration process, you will need to provide an account username and
password of which you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and
security. You agree to (a) notify Staffscanner immediately of any unauthorised use of
your account or if you know or suspect that anyone other than yourself has knowledge
of your username or password (b) accept responsibility for all activities that occur on
your account including liability resulting through unauthorised usage unless such use
is due to the negligent act or omission of Staffscanner. Professionals acknowledge
that Staffscanner will perform relevant checks as it sees fit in its sole discretion which
include but are not limited to PVG Disclosure checks (the cost of which will be
deducted from their first successfully completed shift or which Professionals may be
requested to pay in advance), NMC, SSSC, SVQ, educational, right to work and all
other relevant information to verify that the Professional is permitted to work with the
relevant client group. We reserve the right at our sole discretion to remove or prevent
any Professional or Client from signing up or remove them either on a temporary or
permanent basis – if we do so no correspondence or notice will be given to the
Professional or Client.

Care Providers - posting a Shift
When a Client submits or asks Staffscanner to submit on its behalf a shift, assignment
or job opportunity on our platform, they warrant and represent that (a) the shift,
assignment or job opportunity is true, accurate, current and refers to a genuine
opportunity (b) they will cancel the shift, assignment or job opportunity if the shift,

assignment or job opportunity posted by Client is withdrawn, becomes inaccurate or
non-current.

Clients acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee any shift, assignment or
job opportunities posted via our Services will result in the position being filled.

Without limitation Clients acknowledge and agree not to use our Services to submit
(whether directly or by requesting Staffscanner to submit on their behalf) shift,
assignments or job opportunities that (a) might reasonably be regarded by
Staffscanner as “spam” or may otherwise tend to cause annoyance or inconvenience
to other users of our Services (b) breaches any applicable law or regulation, (c)
impersonates any person, or misrepresents the Client's identity or suggests affiliation
with any person.

Once a Shift (“shift,” “assignment,” or “engagement opportunity”) has been accepted
by the Client, the Client will be able to access a copy of the Professional's Profile
confirming their identity, a summary of completed third party checks including but not
limited to (identity, right to work, disclosure checks, Nursing PIN Number, SSSC
registration number), their employment history, training, any relevant qualifications
and any other information uploaded by the Professional.

Client obligations
The Care Provider acknowledges and accepts their responsibility to provide a safe
working environment along with safe and appropriate equipment for the tasks to be
completed by the Professional. The Care Provider commits to orientating the
Professional at the start of the shift with regards to any relevant risk assessments,
including fire procedures, applicable rules and policies including but not limited to
health and safety, security, and any local regulations.

The Care Provider will ensure during the course of the Professional's engagement
they are not subject to discrimination by any of the Care Provider's employees, service
users or any other third party. The Care Provider shall ensure the Professional is able
to take the same refreshment breaks, meals and facilities as the Care Provider's own
staff which for the purpose of the Shift are not deductible and must be paid at the
Professional's hourly rate.

The Care Provider acknowledges and accepts Staffscanner has no responsibility or
liability for (a) the quality of services performed by the Professional (b) resolving,
mediating or otherwise any disputes between the parties (however at its sole discretion
Staffscanner may opt to undertake an investigation) (c) any losses arising from the
negligent, wrongful, dishonest or fraudulent acts, omissions or misrepresentations of
any Professional (d) any losses arising from the theft, destruction, deletion or damage
of or to any data, computer systems, possessions or materials by any Professional (e)
any loss of profit, business, revenue, goodwill, anticipated savings and/or any claims
made under third party contracts, arising out of any failure by Staffscanner to perform
any obligations under this Agreement.

Cancelling a Shift / Assignment Policy

Shifts or assignments can be cancelled by either the Care Service Provider or Health
Care Professional up to 24 hours prior to the Shift starting free of any fees/charges or
resulting in any disciplinary action.

Care Service Providers that cancel a shift or assignment within 24 hours of the shift or
assignment starting time will be charged 50% of the assignment value and the full
charge which would be payable to Staffscanner had it proceeded.

Health Care Professionals that cancel a shift or assignment within 24 hours of the shift
or assignment starting or during a shift will be subject to disciplinary action and
potentially be removed from the Staffscanner platform.

Health Care Professionals that fail to attend for an assigned shift or assignment will
have their account suspended and possibly terminated pending an investigation.

Health Service Professionals that go absent (for any reason) during a shift or
assignment that has started (unless expressly agreed between the Health Care
Professional and Care Service Provider in writing) will result in the Health Care
Professional's account being suspended and may be prohibited from using the
platform pending an investigation.

As soon as Staffscanner becomes aware of a Health Care Professional cancelling
their “Shift”, Staffscanner will notify the Care Service Provider immediately and use its
reasonable endeavours to source a replacement using the platform. The Care Service
Provider should also “reassign” the shift in order that other Health Care Professionals
can see the shift and apply to this shift.

If either a Care Service Provider or Health Care Professional cancels a shift or
assignment less than 24 hours before the shift or assignment starting, Staffscanner
reserves the right at its sole discretion to suspend or terminate the Care Service
Provider's or Health Care Professional's account without notice and refuse future use
of our site thereafter.

If a Care Service Provider, acting reasonably and in a non-discriminatory fashion
believes a Health Care Professional is unsuitable to perform the “Shift” once they have
arrived at the relevant premises and / or the provision of services by the Health Care
Professional has commenced, the Care Service Provider shall terminate the “Shift” on
the platform and notify Staffscanner immediately in writing, giving the grounds for its
dissatisfaction. The Care Service Provider will be charged for any completed services
(rounded up to the next hour) plus a cancellation charge of 50% of the remaining Shift
or Assignment.

In any event, the Care Service Provider acknowledges and agrees that Staffscanner
shall have no liability to the Care Service Provider whether in contract, delict (including
negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, for any loss, expenses, damage or
delay arising from the Professional cancelling, failing to turn up for or going absent
from a “shift” that has commenced.

Fees and Payment

Professional fees the hourly rate (£/hr) offered on behalf of the Care Service Provider
by Staffscanner when the shift or assignment was accepted by the Health Care
Professional multiplied by the number of hours worked (including the employee on-
costs and Staffscanner Fees).

Staffscanner fees Staffscanner will charge the Care Service Provider a fee based on
the Care Service agreement.

The Care Service Provider will be charged the Health Care Professional's hourly rate
for the hours / time specified when the Shift was accepted by the Health Care
Professional (these are known as the “base hours”). Any time worked over and above
the “base hours” by the Health Care Professional will be rounded up to the nearest
30mins and charged at their hourly rate.

Unless the shift is cancelled by the Care Service Provider (see cancellation policy) the
Health Care Professional will not be paid any less than the base hours.

Staffscanners fees will be charged for the base hours when the Shift was assigned.

When a Health Care Professional works more than the base hours, Staffscanners fees
will be calculated by reference to the actual period worked rounded up to the next full
hour.

Unless the shift is cancelled by the Care Service Provider (see cancellation policy)
Staffscanner will not be paid any less than the base hours.

Upon completion of the Shift, Staffscanner will issue our Invoice and the Health Care
Professional's invoice which will be calculated according to the amount of time worked
by the Health Care Professional, payment for which must be paid in full within 14 days
of the date of the invoice using one of the payment methods specified on the invoice.
If the Care Service Provider fails to pay by the due date, we may (a) charge the Care
Provider interest on amounts outstanding at a rate of 8 % per annum above the Bank
of England base rate which shall accrue daily from the due date until payment of the
overdue amount, (b) remove any Shift or job advertisement placed by the Care
Provider via the Services and suspend your account.

If any Care Service Provider wants to use the Health Care Professional without using
the platform at any time up to 6 months after the Care Service Provider last used
Staffscanner platform, then a resourcing and finder’s fee shall apply as detailed in the
Terms of Business provided to you.

These fees shall be payable immediately. Failure to adhere to this will result in the
Care Service Provider being removed from the platform altogether.

All fees are stated exclusive of VAT which is also payable if applicable.

Specific Terms of Engagement for Professionals

Health Care Professionals acknowledge and accept responsibility for (a) checking the
nature of the Care Provider's business, the details of the engagement, hours, and
location before accepting a proposed engagement (b) for negotiating and agreeing
any specific terms and conditions relating to the shift with the Care Service Provider.

Staffscanner accepts no responsibility for any terms of engagement agreed between
the Health Care Professional and the Care Service Provider once the Shift has been
assigned (with the exception of the resourcing and finder's fee that shall be applicable
for the designated 6 - month period).

You (Health Care Professional) acknowledge and accept that payment for services
completed by you (or any cancellation charge) will be paid directly by the Care Service
Provider and that Staffscanner has no liability for late or non-payment of your fees.

Before you (Health Care Professional) can start using our Services, you will need to
register (see account registration).

To continue using our Service, Health Care Professionals acknowledge and agree to
maintain your information provided at registration making sure it remains current, true,
accurate and complete. Failure to do so will result in your account being suspended
and may result in disciplinary action including dismissal from the Staffscanner
platform.

Duty of Care
All Health Care Professionals acknowledge their “primary” duty of care is to the
resident/patients/service users to which they are charged. Safeguarding of
resident/patients/service users and the effective reporting of adverse incidents is an
integral part of resident/patients/service users’ care. The Health Care Professional’s
duty to safeguard resident/patients/service users is required by professional
regulators, service regulators and supported in law. If a Health Care Professional has
cause to raise a safeguarding concern during or following a shift the primary point of
contact should be the Manager at the Care Service Provider's premises. In all
circumstances the Health Care Professional must contact Staffscanners Safeguarding
and Whistleblowing Officer as soon as possible on HR@staffscanner.co.uk.

Performance rating
Our primary purpose is to ensure the Health Care Professionals deliver the best care
possible and remain accountable to those they care for. As a result, any Health
Care Professional who receives less than the expected ratings, at the sole discretion
of Staffscanner will have their accounts suspended. Care Service Providers are
required to rate the performance of any Health Care Professional engaged by them at
the end of the Shift or Assignment as follows (a) Reliability & Punctuality (b)
Professionalism (c) Clinical Ability and Knowledge (relevant to position) (d)
Communication & Kindness.

Data Protection (GDPR)
Staffscanner and any Care Service Provider that receives and/or processes “User's”
(Health Care Professional's) personal data shall comply at all times with the General
Data Protection Regulations 2018, Data Protection Act 2018 and any other applicable
data protection laws (together "Data Protection Law") and shall not perform its

obligations under these Terms in such a way as to cause the other to breach any of
its obligations under data protection law.

The Health Care Professional acknowledge that the data supplied to Staffscanner will
be shared with the Care Service Provider when the Health Care Professional applies
for a shift.
In the context of these Terms, a Care Service Provider will act as “processor” to
Staffscanner who will be a “controller” with respect to a Health Care Professional's
personal data.

Where any person processes personal data shared by Staffscanner, with respect to
such processing, they shall:

1. process the personal data only in accordance with these Terms and not otherwise
   make any use of the personal data for their own purposes;
2. only permit the personal data to be processed by persons directly employed by the
   Care Service Provider who are bound by enforceable obligations of confidentiality
   and take steps to ensure such persons only act on your instructions in relation to
   the processing;
3. protect the personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against
   accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration or disclosure;

4. promptly alert and inform Staffscanner of any personal data breach;

5. provide all necessary co-operation and assistance to enable Staffscanner to comply
   with our obligations under Data Protection Law and to reduce the impact of the
   incident on our business operations and reputation;
6. on our reasonable request, assist Staffscanner to respond to requests from data
   subjects who are exercising their rights under Data Protection Law; and
7. on our reasonable request, assist Staffscanner to comply with our obligations under
   Data Protection Law in relation to (a) notifying a supervisory authority that We have
   suffered a personal data breach; (b) communicating a personal data breach to an
   affected individual; (c) carrying out an impact assessment; and (d) where required
   under an impact assessment, engaging in prior consultation with a supervisory
   authority unless applicable law requires otherwise, upon termination of these Terms
   at our option, and unless you have a valid and lawful basis under Data Protection
   Law for continuing to hold and process personal data provided by Staffscanner you
   shall:
   (1) delete all such personal data permanently, safely, and securely and provide
   Staffscanner with a certificate of destruction; and/or
   (2) return to Staffscanner all such personal data and any other information provided
   by Staffscanner to You; and
   (3) cease to process the personal data.
   (4) You shall indemnify and hold Staffscanner harmless on demand for any loss,
   damage, liabilities, penalties, expenses or fines incurred (whether foreseeable or
   unforeseeable or direct or indirect) as a result of you breaching your obligations
   under this clause. Personal data may also, when deemed appropriate, be shared
   with third parties including, but not limited to, the police, governing bodies
   (including but not limited to the Care Inspectorate, SSSC, NMC, NHS and Public
   Health Scotland.

Covid- 19
In line with Government Guidance and to ensure the safety of those using the platform
and in the interests of the wider public health, all health care professionals engaged
with Staffscanner are expected to attend for weekly PCR COVID-19 Tests.

Data protection
As Staffscanner will process information that relates to an identified or identifiable
individual, Health Care Professionals registered on the App, we will ensure compliance
with the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Any personal data that relates to
health is classed as ‘special category data’.
The law does not prevent Staffscanner from taking steps to keep those working on the
platform and the wider public safety during the coronavirus crisis. Your data around
the last time you received a Covid- 19 test, and your vaccination data will also be
shared with the Care Providers.

Lawful basis for testing employees
The lawful basis of ‘legitimate interests’, provided there is a good reason for taking this
action, Staffscanner can process health data that concerns Covid-19 testing.
It is important to be clear open and honest with all the health care professional who
work on the Platform and clearly communicate why Staffscanner wishes to use their
personal data. Should anyone wish not to have their data shared then they should
contact Staffscanner and make them aware otherwise this data will be shared.

Disclosing test results to third parties
Staff will be informed of negative or positive test results directly via a text/Email from
NHS Covid-19, in providing your consent you allow Staffscanner to share your test
result with Care Service Providers in the interests of public health.
Data protection law does not prevent Staffscanner from ensuring the health and safety
of those on the platform and staff should consider routes available to share data as
outlined in the law. It should also be considered that there may be risks to the wider
public by not sharing test information.
In providing your consent you agree to book and attend weekly Covid-19 testing, that
you will confirm your test results and furthermore that in the interests of public health
you agree that Staffscanner have your permission to share, where necessary, your
results with Care Service Providers.
